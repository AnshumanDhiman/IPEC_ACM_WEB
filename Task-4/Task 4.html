<p>Technology is the skills, methods, and processes used to achieve goals. People can use technology to: Produce goods or services. Carry out goals, such as scientific investigation or sending a spaceship to the moon.Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology.[12] W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as "a means to fulfill a human purpose."</p>

    <p> Artificial Intelligence is never old and it is continuously evolving to attain various capabilities. Coming years will see the development of AI in ensuring better business predictions, sentiment analysis, and industrial automation. Automation has now become a necessity in most organizations.In the year 2050, technology will dominate the workplace with artificial intelligence and smart assistants being commonplace, while the use of augmented and virtual reality continues to increase. Everything will be 'smart' â€“ connected and data-driven.</p>

<h2>Most robots today are used to do repetitive actions or jobs considered too dangerous for humans. A robot is ideal for going into a building that has a possible bomb. Robots are also used in factories to build things like cars, candy bars, and electronics.Robots save workers from performing dangerous tasks. They can work in hazardous conditions, such as poor lighting, toxic chemicals, or tight spaces. They are capable of lifting heavy loads without injury or tiring. Robots increase worker safety by preventing accidents since humans are not performing risky jobs.</h2>
